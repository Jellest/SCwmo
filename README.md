The focus of this research is to develop an automated SC model that is based on the current classification guidelines defined by the WMO. 

This include the variables:

* temperature
* radiation
* wind environment
* precipitation 

The main output will be based on the exact same calculations and classification values that are currently defined in the WMO SC guidelines.
